# Behaviour-Aware Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This repository contains my MSc Data Science final dissertation project, which investigates behaviour-aware approaches to credit card fraud detection using machine learning. The project focuses on enhancing fraud detection performance by incorporating engineered spending behaviour features alongside traditional transaction attributes.

The work presents an end-to-end analytical pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and interpretation, with an emphasis on robustness, interpretability, and real-world applicability.

---

## Research Objectives
- To analyse transactional and behavioural patterns associated with fraudulent activity
- To engineer behaviour-aware features that capture spending habits and temporal dynamics
- To evaluate and compare machine learning models for fraud detection
- To assess model performance using appropriate metrics for imbalanced classification problems

---

## Methodology
The project follows a structured machine learning workflow:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Behavioural feature engineering (e.g. spending frequency, temporal patterns)
- Handling class imbalance
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Interpretation of results and discussion of findings

---

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Tree-based ensemble methods
- Additional comparative models as explored in the dissertation

Model selection prioritises both predictive performance and interpretability.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualisation)
